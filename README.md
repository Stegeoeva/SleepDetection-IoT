# SleepDetection-IoT
The aim of the study is to detect and estimate the duration of sleep interval from acceloremeter data recordings of 3 different participants. 
The algorithm constructed was based on Van Hees et al., 2015. and calculates the total sleep time through the change in hand/wrist angle during sleep.
More specifically, if the hand/wrist angle does not change by more than 5° for 5 or 10 consecutive minutes, then it is defined that for that period of time the person is asleep.
